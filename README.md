# Student_Record_Management_System
I developed a Student Record Management System in C as our first-semester final project. This system allows users to view, search, add, delete, and edit student data. All the information is stored using file handling, ensuring data accuracy and ease of access. It was a valuable learning experience that helped me improve my programming skills.
